# GodotTetris

This game was created just the see how the Godot Game Engine works and to practice game development a little.


## Controls

Use the arrows to rotate and move.


## Why I choose to draw everything by hand instead of using the GUI tools like some tutorials?

Because I wanted to learn about Godot API first. This way I could check what Godot has to offer for game development without having to learn all the details of its user interface.
